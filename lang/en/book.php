                            Many existing books and articles discuss specific temple ordinances, but the historical development of all temple ordinances has never been included in a single volume -- until now. <span class="italic">Wilford Woodruff\'s Witness</span> provides new insight even to those who are very familiar with the history of the Restoration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
The account unfolds in Wilford Woodruff\'s own words, drawn from primary sources including his journals, discourses, and letters, and the narrative is augmented by 120 archival images, as well as extensive footnotes and citations allowing for further study.

    'Author Bio' => '<p>
                        Jennifer Ann Mackley is a native of Seattle, Washington. Her curiosity about Wilford Woodruff\'s vision of the Founding Fathers in 1877 led to her 15-year odyssey researching Wilford\'s life within the context of LDS Church history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2019 Jennifer co-founded the Wilford Woodruff Papers Foundation with BYU professor Donald W. Parry to make all of Wilford Woodruff’s writing universally accessible online at <a href="https://www.wilfordwoodruffpapers.org" class="text-secondary">wilfordwoodruffpapers.org</a>. Her hope in transcribing and publishing Wilford Woodruff\'s Papers is to help Church members and historians alike understand the importance of the temple and gain insights into the Restoration through Wilford\'s unique perspective of the revelatory process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prior to becoming Executive Director of the Foundation, she worked as an attorney for 25 years and formed Mackley & Mackley, PLLC with her husband Carter. They are the parents of three miraculous children.
